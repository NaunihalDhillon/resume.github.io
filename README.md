# resume.github.io

Created my Resume and the design is created using Bootstrap 5. The design image is what I got from online, but the webpage and CSS I have designed my self using bootstrap classes. 

Created 4 Sections as Navbar, about section, services, contact.
In the contact section I have used PHP for the form submission and used bootstrap columns for displaying location, phone number. Used Font-Awesome for icons

In the about section I have used bootstrap columns containing image and progress bar.
In the services column used the col-md-6 and col-lg-6 for the cards and hover effect is also given which changes color.
